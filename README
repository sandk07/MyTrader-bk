This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibilities of the Axon framework in a high load environment. We have chosen to create a Trader application. All you need to run it is java, mongodb and maven.

Initial setup
-------------
- Make sure you have java installed
http://www.java.com/download/

- Make sure you have maven installed
http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation

- You can use mongodb to run the sample,  if so make sure you have mongodb installed
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart

When using mongodb in a test environment, it is easiest to just start one instance with the default port on your local machine. If you want another setup, you can find more information in the advanced configuration section.

Running the sample
------------------
- First you need to download the source code, if you are reading this file on your local machine you already have downloaded the source code. If you are on the main page of the Github project, you can easily find a url to clone the repository or to download a zip with all the sources.

* Maven
- Step into the main folder of the project
> mvn tomcat7:run
- Browse to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the user accounts that you can use to login.
(You can always refresh the data by calling /data/init on the application)

Running with MongoDB
--------------------
- This is easiest when running within an IDE, but can also be run on a separate tomcat instance
- Add a system variable to configure the mongodb profile:
    -Dspring.profiles.active=mongodb

More documentation

We are documenting the sample on the wiki of the github project.
